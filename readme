<!-- Steps to run the code :

Note: Wait for the project to set up properly and then follow the steps.

1. Open a terminal, change directory to the location where mongodb/bin is located.
2. Start the mongodb server using './mongod' command.
3. Now come to the main file "JumbotailAssignmentApplication.java" and run this file.

After the file has run, all the logs will be visible on the terminal - event creation, enqueuing, pushing in the db and api response times.

Different Endpoints : 
http://localhost:8888/webhook -> POST request for pushing event batches in queue
http://localhost:8888/queueContents -> GET request to view events in the queue
http://localhost:8888/percentageInStage?stage=[Any stage from stages/events list] -> Get request to get percentage of users at the particulat stage in the app.
http://localhost:8888/percentageInCity?city=[Any city from cities list] -> Get request to get percentage of users from a particular city.

Cities list -> [City1, City2, City3, City4, City5]
Events list -> [AccessApp, ClickBanner, ViewProducts, SelectProduct, AddToCart]

Note : Number of users and cities can be increased as required, but currently for simplicity, limited number of cities and users are taken.
